This is the Mono Project's project ideas page. For general information and rules about participating in
[Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](http://code.google.com/soc/) for the Mono Project, please see our
[overview page](/community/google-summer-of-code/).

This page lists some ideas for Mono GSoC projects that students can apply for. Additionally, we encourage students
to submit their own interesting Mono-related project proposals. In past years, roughly 20% of the accepted
proposals were original ideas from students instead of from our suggestions. You can submit more than one proposal,
so you can submit your own ideas as well as apply for one from this list - but only one can be chosen, of course!

Other Ideas
===========

If a project is not listed here, but you think you have a great idea, feel free to
[contact the Mono team, mentors and org admins](#contacting-the-mono-team) to discuss or suggest your own project ideas.

Over the past years we have picked projects that were not listed here because they were great ideas, and we had students
that were passionate about those projects. In the end, most of these projects were a success.

Do not be afraid to pick up a project that would be interesting and also help the Mono universe.

You can find some additional ideas on the [MonkeySquare ideas page](http://monkeysquare.org/gsoc/projects), and on the
[Gnome ideas page](https://live.gnome.org/SummerOfCode2013/Ideas) (Mono-based projects in Gnome: Banshee, Blam, Tasque,

Microsoft .NET and Mono Integration
===================================

Microsoft open sourced large chunks of code this year:

- ReferenceSource: the source code for the class libraries of .NET as it ships on Windows
- CoreFX: a fresh take on the distribution of the class libraries for a new, slimmer, smaller runtime
- CoreCLR: their C/C++ based runtime, JIT, GC for running on Mac, Linux and Windows
- Roslyn: Microsoft's C# and VB compiler as a service
- CodeContracts: the tools needed to instrument your code

We are tracking various ideas in the [.NET Integration in Mono](https://trello.com/b/vRPTMfdz/net-framework-integration-into-mono) trello board.

Port CoreCLR Features to Mono
-----------------------------

**Complexity:** Hard

We are interested in allowing Mono to optionally use components of the CoreCLR, like their Garbage Collector or their JIT, or extend Mono to support some of the features that the CoreCLR JIT now has, and Mono lacks (like the recently introduced Microsoft SIMD support).

Your proposal should identify the CoreCLR features you wish to port and explain why it is beneficial to port them.

**Deliverables**: Port a CoreCLR feature of your choice to the Mono runtime.

**Mentors:** Ludovic Henry

Integrate Reference Sources code into Mono
------------------------------------------

**Complexity:** Medium

While the Mono team has replaced some parts of the Mono class libraries with code from Microsoft, we have found that some of the interesting bits are either tied to the Windows platform, is not portable, or will not work with Mono’s multi-profile facades.

We are interested in students that would like to take on the challenge of porting existing ReferenceSource code to Linux, Mac, Unix, Android, iOS and making it available to both Mono and the CoreFX efforts.

The things that we are interested in porting are tracked in [this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/vRPTMfdz/net-framework-integration-into-mono).

Your proposal should identify the features you wish to port and explain why it is beneficial to port them.

**Deliverables**: Port Reference Sources code of your choice to Mono.

**Mentors:** Ludovic Henry

Compilers and Tools
===================

CppSharp | Improve C++ inline code / default arguments bindings
---------------------------------------------------------------

**Complexity:** Medium

As part of this task you'll need to extend CppSharp's support for binding C++ functions/methods with default arguments and handling of inlined code.

Both of these features rely on extending the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) layer in CppSharp to support expressions and statement nodes.

To get an idea of the information provided by Clang's AST you can view it's class reference for [Expression](http://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1Expr.html) and [Statement](http://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1Stmt.html). For the default arguments work only a subset of the expression nodes will be needed so it might be a good way to start with those. The rest can be done iteratively as they are needed.

With this information available, the generator can then be extended to take advantage of it.

We already have some work-in-progress support for default arguments but it's done in a flawed way. It does a mix of string parsing and parser hacks to figure out the types of the default arguments. It'd be nice to replace it with something more robust based by making the translation of C++ types to C# at the generator level with support from the information in the AST.

Inlined code is currently problematic because it's not exported in the shared object when compiled, so there's no way to call it from C#. This can even happen when the code is not marked with the inline keyword (the compiler uses some heuristics to classify some functions/methods as inline). This could be improved with the AST information because we could convert a subset of C++ to C#. Code considered as inline is usually not very complicated so we should be able to solve a big chunk of this problem with something relatively simple.

The main tasks would be:

1. Add expressions/statements support to the managed AST layer
2. Improve the C++ parsing layer to bind Clang's AST to the one defined in 1.
3. Extend the binding generator backends to rely on the information from the managed AST and generate better code

MonoDevelop / Xamarin Studio IDE
================================

Overhaul MonoDevelop C/C++ addin
--------------------------------

**Complexity:** Medium

The MonoDevelop C/C++ addin has been unmaintained for some time. We would like to move it to a standalone addin so it is more easily maintainable, and improve its core project model to use with MSBuild or CMake.

There are many other aspects of the addin that could be improved, such as:

- improving the code completion using libclang instead of CTags
- adding refactoring support
- improving the GDB debugger addin or switching to LLDB
- making the addin usable on Windows with msvc, clang and/or mingw32 gcc.

Your proposal can include any of that you find interesting and feel can be realistically be completed in addition to the core tasks.

**Deliverables:** a standalone C/C++ addin that uses MSBuild or CMake, along with other improvements of your choosing

**Mentors:** Michael Hutchinson, João Matos

Improve Auto-Documentation System
---------------------------------

**Complexity:** Medium

MonoDevelop has an addin that automatically generates documentation comments based on the member types and  naming conventions. This is very useful, as it gets the boilerplate out the way leaving more time for the developer to add meaningful details.

However, sometimes its assumptions do not hold and the resulting docs  do not make sense. Although this is funny, we would like to fix it.

This is an ideal project for a student interested in linguistics, parsing & understanding natural language.

Your proposal should describe the approaches you intend to use to fix the issue, and a number of cases where the generated docs could be improved.

**Deliverables:** Fix the docs generation for the cases covered in your proposal.

**Mentors:** Mike Krüger

Port NRefactory 5 Actions/Issues to NRefactory 6
------------------------------------------------

**Complexity:** Medium

NRefactory is the library used by MonoDevelop for parsing, analysis and refactoring of C# code. The upcoming NR6 is completely rebased on the Microsoft Roslyn compiler, but many of the analysis features have not yet been ported. Your task would be to port a number of Code Actions and Code Issues of your choice.

**Deliverables**: Port the Code Actions and Code issues listed in your proposal to NR6

**Mentors:** Mike Krüger

MD Class Diagrams
-----------------

**Complexity:** Medium

Addin to generate UML-like class diagrams

Creating an addin for MonoDevelop to generate UML style class diagrams would give developers an easy way to view class structure and relationships.

This project is ideal for a student interested in code documentation and code design.

Your proposal should include what form you think the class diagrams will take, as well as your intended method of implementing the solution.

**Deliverables**: A MonoDevelop addin for generating class diagrams.

**Mentors:** Michael Hutchinson

Adding Version Control Backends
-------------------------------

**Complexity:** Easy

MonoDevelop has support for a plugging new Version Control systems. Currently, Subversion and Git support is implemented.

Community versions of TFS and HG exist, so implementing those are a really low priority.

Having additional systems would add diversity to the options developers have when they want IDE support for Version Control.

This is an ideal project for a student interested in version control integration and version control system bindings.

Your proposal should describe the approaches you intend to use to implement the support, your experience with the chosen system(s).

**Deliverables**: Add support for other version control systems in self-contained addins.

**Mentors:** Marius Ungureanu

Syntax Highlighting Overhaul
----------------------------

**Complexity:** Medium

The syntax highlighting in MonoDevelop is done by defining a grammar as xml file to colorize tokens. Some highlightings are extended with hand written code. The highlighting system can be made faster (maybe with an on the fly compiler approach), more extensible (atm it’s difficult to write semantic highlightings) and more scaleable . You will first need to understand how our highlighting files are defined and how the semantic highlighting currently works. After that a new implementation approach needs to be implemented. One of our current drawbacks are that regular expressions could be integrated better - for example span begin/end constructs aren’t atm regular. In fact everything should be based on regular expressions.

**Deliverables**: An extensible syntax highlighting system that reads our xml files or a similar format. It should be scalable even for large files (lazy analysis) and much faster than the current implementation (speed tests included).

**Mentors:** Mike Krüger

Debugger Tasks window support
-----------------------------

**Complexity:** Medium

Since async and await keywords were introduced, tasks have become crucial part of development process. With the Tasks window, a user will be able to easily see current task state (Scheduled, Executing, Waiting or Deadlocked). More information: <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd998369.aspx>

**Deliverables:** Tasks window implemented in MonoDevelop.

**Mentors:** David Karlas

Debugging disassembled code could use C# decompiler to generate source
----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Complexity:** Medium

MonoDevelop already has IL->C# logic, and the debugger already supports stepping into methods without code. These two components have to be combined to give a user the option to see C# code instead of IL when stepping into methods without source code.

**Deliverables:** Ability to see C# instead of IL when debugging methods without source code.

**Mentors:** David Karlas, Jeff Stedfast

Mono Runtime
============

Port mono to asm.js
-------------------

**Complexity:** Hard

asm.js is the new big thing in the web.

Port mono to work on it. This project should be able to:

- Get the mono runtime compiled with emscripten
- Get a mono cross compiler that can target emscripten

Mash everything together and get it to work. No threads or GC support for this is needed.

**Deliverables:** A asm.js hello world running in a browser.

**Mentors:** João Matos, Alexis Christoforides

Add PortablePDB support into the Mono ecosystem
-----------------------------------------------

**Complexity:** Medium

PortablePDB is the new debug format proposed by the Roslyn team.

This project would introduce support for it over the Mono ecosystem. This includes:

- The mono runtime needs to be able to parse it.
- Cecil must be able to parse and write this format.
- IKVM.Reflect must be able to write this format.
- MCS must be able to generate this format.
- SDB (mono's debugger) must be able to use it.
- MonoDevelop can give a better debug experience by reading it.

Each of those bullets is not enough for a single student over summer, but all of them are too much. So pick and choose which ones you want to do.

**Deliverables:** One or more of the above bullet points.

Resources:

Specification: <https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/portable-pdb/docs/specs/PortablePdb-Metadata.md>

Roslyn's generator: <https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/tree/portable-pdb>

Branch of CoreFX with the metadata writer for portable PDB:

<https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/tree/dev/metadata/src/System.Reflection.Metadata>

**Mentors:** João Matos, Alexis Christoforides

Port mono to WinRT
------------------

**Complexity:** Hard

WinRT is the runtime sandbox where Windows Store apps run in.

Right now mono doesn't run on it.

The goal of this project is to get the runtime to compile for WinRT and get
a simple hello world APP working.

**Deliverables:** A hello world running in the WinRT sandbox.

**Mentors:** João Matos, Alexis Christoforides

Implement a LLDB plugin that can understands the mono runtime
-------------------------------------------------------------

**Complexity:** Hard

LLDB support plugins and we should write one that exposes as much as possible of the runtime. A few ideas:

- object layout, introspection and heap walking
- unwinding and symbolifying managed methods
- lookup line information for managed methods
- pretty print all runtime structs
- threadpool introspection?

**Deliverables:** One or more of the above bullet points.

**Mentors:** João Matos, Alexis Christoforides

Make the SGen garbage collector work independently of Mono
----------------------------------------------------------

**Complexity:** Medium

We've begun work on making Mono's garbage collector, SGen, work independently of Mono, for embedding in other programming language implementations:

  <https://github.com/schani/mono/tree/sgen-independence>
  <https://github.com/schani/simple-sgen-client>

It still needs a lot of polishing, documentation, and has to be brought into a state where it can be merged with Mono.  That includes doing benchmarking to make sure it doesn't regress in performance or memory usage.

It also needs a nontrivial project to use it.  Ideally another free language implementation that needs a better GC.

Your proposal should include how you plan to benchmark SGen, and some candidates for other languages to implement it in.

**Deliverables**: SGen garbage collector successfully working with another free language implementation.

**Mentors:** Mark Probst

Port the coreclr GC to work on top of Mono
------------------------------------------

**Complexity:** Hard

With the recent open sourcing of CoreCLR comes CoreCLR's garbage collector, which has a quite well definted interface. Porting this to work with mono would be a great student project.

**Deliverables**: A working mono port of the CoreCLR garbage collector.

**Mentors:** Mark Probst

Show Referring Objects in Debugger
----------------------------------

**Complexity:** Medium

IntelliJ's debugger has a feature "Show Referring Objects", which displays a list of all objects that reference a given object:

  <http://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2014/09/intellij-idea-14-eap-138-1980-1-is-out/>

Wouldn't it be nice if the mono debugger had that feature, too?  SGen already has the functionality for internal debugging (it doesn't handle all states the heap can be in, but that can be arranged).

There's two major components to this project--the runtime and debugger support to surface this information, and the UI elements to make that information human-readable.

Your proposal should include which components of the project you wish to work on, and how you plan on implementing your solution.

**Deliverables**: Mono runtime support to show referring objects, and some UI implementation of referring objects information.

**Mentors:** David Karlas, Mark Probst

Implement System.Numerics.Vectors
---------------------------------

**Complexity:** Hard

Implement the MS System.Numerics.Vectors SIMD library and include JIT support to hardware-accelerate it using SSE on x86/AMD64.

**Deliverables:** Implement System.Numerics.Vectors and JIT support on x86 and/or AMD64.

**Mentors:** Alexis Christoforides

GTK# and Bindings
==================

CppSharp | Continue Mono/.NET bindings for Qt
---------------------------------------------

**Complexity:** Medium

As part of this task you’ll need to continue the bindings effort for the Qt framework so that it can be used with Mono/.NET languages such as C#, similar to the existing bindings of GTK# for GTK+.

Qt, while an excellent development platform, has been notorious for its lack of bindings for many languages. The reason is that it's written in C++ and does not have a C API. This means that the task involves using CppSharp to generate the C# code. A large part of the work has been completed in the [QtSharp](https://github.com/ddobrev/QtSharp) project.

Most of the task involves contribution to CppSharp itself because as the generator it does the overwhelming majority of the work. In particular, QtSharp needs the following features to be present in CppSharp:

1. Support for instantiated templates (non-instantiated templates are impossible to support save for entirely rewriting them in C#);
2. A map between managed objects and their unmanaged counterparts – if we call in C# a method returning a pointer, subsequent calls to that method must return the same managed object rather than create a new one. Therefore we need to keep a map with the key a pointer and the value its managed representation so that we can get the same managed object each time. When an unmanaged object is deleted, we must remove its entry from this map;
3. Support for dependencies between wrapped modules – this feature is partially done. It has to mirror the dependencies between the unmanaged libraries in the managed side. That is, as QtGui depends on QtCore, the wrapper of QtGui must depend on QtCore, otherwise the binding cannot have the types it needs.

Besides that major part, the task involves a few Qt specifics. Some of them are already done, such as generating XML documentation by parsing the documentaion of Qt. So this part is mostly about creating type maps: mapping common Qt types to common CLI ones. The most important examples would be:

1. QList<>, QVector<> ↔ List<>;
2. QMap<,>, QHash<,> ↔ Dictionary<,>;
3. QChar<> ↔ char;

Some cases, such as QFile(Info) ↔ File(Info) or QDir ↔ Directory(Info), need some more consideration. In some cases both have features their counterpart lacks, in other cases people would just prefer the Qt API. So the priority of this part goes to the most basic types as enumerated in the list above.

The last part is testing and fixing any crashes or incorrect behaviour. Unit tests are especially welcome. A good starting point can be porting some of the Qt examples to C# and then checking if they behave the same way as their original counterparts.

<https://github.com/ddobrev/QtSharp>
<https://techbase.kde.org/Development/Languages/Qyoto> – obsolete bindings for Qt which can however give some ideas, for example for type maps

Feel free to get in touch with @tritao if you’re interested in this and would like more guidance.

**Deliverables**: Improve the QT bindings generator to the point that they can be used for a non-trivial QT sample written in idiomatic C#.
