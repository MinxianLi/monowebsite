Mono 4.2 is out in the [alpha channel](/download/alpha/).

Check out our [release notes](/docs/about-mono/releases/4.2.0/)
for details about what is new on Mono 4.2.0.

This is the second Mono release that integrates large portions of code
from [Microsoft's open sourced .NET
code](https://github.com/mono/referencesource).

This release was made up of over 2,338 commits since Mono 4.0.0 and as
usual, it is our best release so far.   Enjoy!
