The Mono runtime implements a debugging interface that allows debuggers and IDEs to debug managed code. This is called the [Soft Debugger](/docs/advanced/runtime/docs/soft-debugger/) and is supported by both MonoDevelop, Xamarin Studio and Visual Studio (when the appropriate plugins are installed) as well as the command line [SDB client](https://github.com/mono/sdb).

Mono provides an API to communicate with the debugger and create your own debugging UIs via the Mono.Debugger.Soft.dll assembly

In addition, if you can [use the Unix GDB debugger with Mono](/docs/debug+profile/debug/) to debug low level problems.
